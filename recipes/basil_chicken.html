    <h1>Spicy Thai Basil Chicken (Pad Krapow Gai)</h1>
    <img src="../images/basil_chicken.png" alt="Basil Chicken">
    <p>My version of this classic Thai dish has spectacular taste even with regular basil instead of Thai or holy basil. The sauce actually acts like a glaze as the chicken mixture cooks over high heat. The recipe works best if you chop or grind your own chicken and have all ingredients prepped before you start cooking</p>
